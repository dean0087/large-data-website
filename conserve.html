      <h1>Bear Conservation</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Bears face serious threats on many fronts, most of which are due to human activity. Whether indirect, as in human encroachment on their natural habitats due to crop cultivation, deforestation or timber harvest, or directly from their killing for protection of property or for unregulated or sport hunting, or for their use in primitive medicines and aphrodisiacs.</p>
      <p class="subtitle">Bear conservation efforts vary from the intensive and highly organized management of the grizzly bear in the United States to little or no management of most Asian species.
Likewise, successful international co-operation in conservation and management is exemplified by the work done on the polar bear in the Arctic. Several other species also need international cooperation to if they are to survive.</p>

      <h2>Bear News</h2>
	  <h3>Updated: Oct. 28, 2013</h3>
      <p>A black bear on the loose 20 miles north of downtown Los Angeles was captured Tuesday evening after a day-long romp through backyards, woods and a golf course.</p>

<p>A California game warden shot the bear with a tranquilizer dart about 5 p.m. PT as it ran across a golf course in Granada Hills, and authorities found the animal an hour later passed out under a bougainvillea bush in the backyard of a nearby home, KTLA-TV reported.</p>

<p>The bear had a tracking tag above its left ear, meaning it had wandered into an urban area before. Wildlife officers planned to take the animal deeper into the Angeles National Forest than where it was relocated after its previous adventure.<p>
