      <h2>Bear News</h2>
	  <h3>Updated: Oct. 28, 2013</h3>
      <p>A black bear on the loose 20 miles north of downtown Los Angeles was captured Tuesday evening after a day-long romp through backyards, woods and a golf course.</p>

<p>A California game warden shot the bear with a tranquilizer dart about 5 p.m. PT as it ran across a golf course in Granada Hills, and authorities found the animal an hour later passed out under a bougainvillea bush in the backyard of a nearby home, KTLA-TV reported.</p>

<p>The bear had a tracking tag above its left ear, meaning it had wandered into an urban area before. Wildlife officers planned to take the animal deeper into the Angeles National Forest than where it was relocated after its previous adventure.<p>
