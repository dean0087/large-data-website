		<h2>Asian Bears</h2>
		<ul>
		  
			
		  
			
		  
			
			  <h3>Asiatic Black Bear</h3>
			  <img src="/img/asiaticblackbear.jpg" alt="Photo of Asiatic Black Bear" class="bear-img">
			  <p><strong>Weight:</strong> 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lbs)</p>
			  <p>The Asian black bear , also known as the moon bear or white-chested bear, is a medium-sized species of bear, largely adapted for arboreal life, seen across much of the Himalayas and the northern parts of the Indian Subcontinent, Taiwan, Korea, northeastern China, the Russian far east and the Honshū and Shikoku islands of Japan. It is classed by the IUCN as a vulnerable species, mostly due to deforestation and active hunting for its body parts. The species is morphologically very similar to some prehistoric bears, and is thought by some scientists to be the ancestor of other extant bear species. Though largely herbivorous, Asian black bears can be very aggressive toward humans, and have frequently attacked people without provocation.</p>
			
		  
			
			  <h3>Panda</h3>
			  <img src="/img/pandabear.jpg" alt="Photo of Panda" class="bear-img">
			  <p><strong>Weight:</strong> 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb)</p>
			  <p>The panda , also known as the giant panda to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda, is a bear native to south central China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the panda's diet is 99% bamboo. Pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food</p>
			
		  
			
			  <h3>Sloth Bear</h3>
			  <img src="/img/slothbear.jpg" alt="Photo of Sloth Bear" class="bear-img">
			  <p><strong>Weight:</strong> 80 to 192 kg (176 to 423 lb)</p>
			  <p>The sloth bear, also known as the Stickney bear or labiated bear, is a nocturnal insectivorous species of bears found wild within the Indian Subcontinent. The sloth bear evolved from ancestral brown bears during the Pleistocene and shares features found in insect-eating mammals through convergent evolution. The population isolated in Sri Lanka is considered as a subspecies. Unlike brown and black bears, sloth bears have lankier builds, long, shaggy coats that form a mane around the face, long, sickle-shaped claws, and a specially adapted lower lip and palate used for sucking insects. Sloth bears breed during spring and early summer and give birth near the beginning of winter. They feed on termites, honeybee colonies, and fruits. Sloth bears sometimes attack humans who encroach on their territories.</p>
			
		  
			
			  <h3>Sun Bear</h3>
			  <img src="/img/sunbear.jpg" alt="Photo of Sun Bear" class="bear-img">
			  <p><strong>Weight:</strong> 27 to 65 kg (60 to 143 lb)</p>
			  <p>The sun bear is a bear found in tropical forest habitats of Southeast Asia. It is classified as Vulnerable by IUCN as the large-scale deforestation that has occurred throughout Southeast Asia over the past three decades has dramatically reduced suitable habitat for the sun bear. It is suspected that the global population has declined by more than 30% over the past three bear generations.</p>
