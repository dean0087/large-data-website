info: The short-faced bear or bulldog bear, or Arctodus , is an extinct genus of bear endemic to North America during the Pleistocene about 3.0 Mya â€“ 11,000 years ago, existing for around three million years. Arctodus simus may have once been Earth's largest mammalian, terrestrial carnivore. The species described are all thought to have been larger than any living species of bear. It was the most common of early North American bears, being most abundant in California.
