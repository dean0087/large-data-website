info: Fozzie Bear is a Muppet character created by Jim Henson and developed by Frank Oz. Fozzie is an orange-brown, fuzzy bear who often wears a brown pork pie hat and a red-and-white polka-dot necktie. The character debuted on The Muppet Show, as the show's stand-up comic, a role where he constantly employed his catchphrase, "Wocka Wocka Wocka!". Shortly after telling the joke, he was usually the target of ridicule, particularly from hecklers Statler and Waldorf.
