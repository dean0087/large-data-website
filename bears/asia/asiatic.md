info: The Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus), also known as the moon bear[2] or white-chested bear,[3] is a medium-sized species of bear, largely adapted for arboreal life, seen across much of the Himalayas and the northern parts of the Indian Subcontinent, Taiwan, Korea, northeastern China, the Russian far east and the Honshū and Shikoku islands of Japan. It is classed by the IUCN as a vulnerable species, mostly due to deforestation and active hunting for its body parts. The species is morphologically very similar to some prehistoric bears, and is thought by some scientists to be the ancestor of other extant bear species.[2] Though largely herbivorous, Asian black bears can be very aggressive toward humans, and have frequently attacked people without provocation.
