    <h1>BEARS</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">If You Encounter a Bear:</p>
		<ul> 
			<li>Remain calm and avoid sudden movements.</li>
			<li>Give the bear plenty of room, allowing it to continue its activities undisturbed. If it changes its behavior, you're too close so back away.</li>
			<li>If you see a bear but the bear doesn't see you, detour quickly and quietly.</li>
			<li>If a bear spots you, try to get its attention while it is still farther away. You want it to know you're human so talk in a normal voice and waive your arms.	</li>
			<li>Remember that a standing bear is not always a sign of aggression. Many times, bears will stand to get a better view.</li>
			<li>Throw something onto the ground (like your camera) if the bear pursues you, as it may be distracted by this and allow you to escape.</li>
			<li>Never feed or throw food to a bear.</li>
		</ul>
	
	<p>If a Bear Charges:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Remember that many bears charge as a bluff. They may run, then veer off or stop abruptly. Stand your ground until the bear stops, then slowly back away.</li>
			<li>Never run from a bear! They will chase you and bears can run faster than 30 mph.</li>
			<li>Don't run towards or climb a tree. Black bears and some grizzlies can climb trees, and many bear will be provoked to chase you if they see you climbing.</li>
			<li>If you have pepper spray, be sure that you have trained with it before using it during an attack.</li>
		</ul>

      <h2>Bear News</h2>
	  <h3>Updated: Oct. 28, 2013</h3>
      <p>A black bear on the loose 20 miles north of downtown Los Angeles was captured Tuesday evening after a day-long romp through backyards, woods and a golf course.</p>

<p>A California game warden shot the bear with a tranquilizer dart about 5 p.m. PT as it ran across a golf course in Granada Hills, and authorities found the animal an hour later passed out under a bougainvillea bush in the backyard of a nearby home, KTLA-TV reported.</p>

<p>The bear had a tracking tag above its left ear, meaning it had wandered into an urban area before. Wildlife officers planned to take the animal deeper into the Angeles National Forest than where it was relocated after its previous adventure.<p>
