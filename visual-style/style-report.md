Style 1

I went for a simple style for this one. It's not flash, but it is simple and effective.

Style 2

I picked earthy colours to go with this one. It matches the forest environment that bears inhabit.

Style 3

I tried something drastically different for this one. I went with a flatter layout with a dark base and light text.


I think style 2 is most appropriate for my users. It's crisp, simple, and it offers some colour.
