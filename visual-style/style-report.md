##Style 1

I went for a simple style for this one. It's not flash, but it is simple and effective.

###Pros
This one is the least flashy. It's straight forward and to the point.

###Cons
This one is a bit boring, so regardless of the content's value the viewer may become disinterested.

##Style 2

I picked earthy colours to go with this one. It matches the forest environment that bears inhabit.

###Pros
This design has the most colour and is quite simple in terms of type.

###Cons
I think this is the best one, don't see much wrong with it.

##Style 3

I tried something drastically different for this one. I went with a flatter layout with a dark base and light text.

###Pros
This one is something different.


###Cons
White text may be difficult to read, even on a dark background. 

##Conclusion
I think style 2 is most appropriate for my users. It's crisp, simple, and it offers some colour.
