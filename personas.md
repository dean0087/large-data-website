**Personal Goals**

**Why is the website important?**

Randy would use the webiste to see what bears, if any, are in an area he is geologically surveying. He could also learn techniques in safety regarding a surprise encounter. He could also check to see if bears are around if he were to take his family camping or on vacation somewhere. He is prone to jumping headfirst into fads, so if something bear related came up it would be his first spot for info.
