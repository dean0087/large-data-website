**Grizzly Bears *Ursus arctos* **

**Location:** North American

**Height / Weight:** 6'5" / 750lbs

Grizzly Bears inhabit most of North America. They're habitat can vary greatly, some live on the coast, whereas others are far inland. The coastal grizzlies are much much larger than their inland counterparts. This is due to their nutrient rich diet of salmon, whereas the inland grizzlies rely on less protein rich food sources.
